## 📅 Day 1: Python Basics, Data Structures & OOP

On the first day of my internship, I covered fundamental Python concepts along with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Error Handling.

### 🚀 Key Concepts Covered:
- **Core Python:** Loops (`for`, `range`) and Math functions.
- **Data Structures:** Working with `Sets` and `Dictionaries`.
- **OOP:** Classes, Inheritance, and Method Overriding.
- **File Handling:** Reading files and handling errors with `try-except`.

### ✅ Tasks Completed:

1.  **Area of Circle:** Calculated area using user input radius and `math.pi`.
2.  **Reverse Loop:** Printed numbers from 20 down to 1 using a `for` loop.
3.  **Prime Checker:** Created a function `is_prime(n)` to check for prime numbers.
4.  **Unique Words:** Used a **Set** to find unique words in a string.
5.  **File Reader:** Read a text file (`poem.txt`) to count lines.
6.  **Phonebook Dict:** Built a dictionary for contact storage.
7.  **OOP (Inheritance):**
    - Created a base class `Animal` and derived class `Dog`.
    - Used **Method Overriding** for the `speak()` function.
8.  **Error Handling:** Used `try-except` to handle "File not found" errors safely.
